        <h2>About me</h2>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I will be attaining a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May 2023. 
            I have taken many classes over my time at UVA such as Machine Learning, Operating Systems,  
            Algorithms, Advanced Software Development, Database Systems,
            Mobile Application Development and many more. Through these classes I have gained a lot of knowledge such as
            learning languages like Java, Python, C++ and more. Also, I learned how to work in teams to complete projects
            with strict deadlines that utilized an agile project style. Ultimately, through my education I have become much better 
            at computer science and can't wait to utilize the skills I have learned for the next step in my life.
